|02/14/2022  |Build Finance | | | Governance exploit | |The exploiter proposed and honestly voted for a proposal which gave him control over the contract, including the minting function, and assets in the treasury. Token holders were given several days’ notice and encouraged to vote against the proposal. The proposal passed; all of the treasury’s assets were all sold off, and the exploiter minted enough BUILD tokens to drain BUILD-paired pools of other assets |$522k |$470k |https://twitter.com/finance_build/status/1493223190071554049 |
|08/01/2023  |Circle |Ethereum | | Vampire exploit | |Tether is actively vampire attacking USDC.

|10/15/2021  |Indexed Finance |Ethereum | | System design |Liquidity |The exploiter exploited Indexed Finance by using flash loans to manipulate the weights of assets in the DEFI5 and CC10 pools. This allowed him to deposit small amounts of over-weighted SUSHI tokens, minting inflated DEFI5 tokens which were then cashed out for other assets, resulting in a $16 million loss. |~$16M |~$16M |[https://rekt.news/indexed-finance-rekt/](https://rekt.news/indexed-finance-rekt/) |

|06/28/2021  |SafeDollar |Polygon  | |System design | |The economic exploit in the SafeDollar case involved manipulating the protocol's reward mechanism to claim enormous amounts of SDO tokens.

|02/05/2021  |Yearn |Ethereum | | |The Yearn exploit involved arbitrage of the Yearn DAI v1 vault using 9 flash loans. The exploiter executed a series of complex transactions to manipulate the vault and withdraw funds. The exploit was possible because the withdrawal fee had been turned off for vault migration, making it an opportunistic exploit rather than a fundamental flaw in Yearn's economic design |$11m |$2.7m |[https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt/](https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt/) |

|10/11/2023| Synthetify DAO| Solana | |Governance Exploit|Upgradeable Contract| A combination of a low threshold to pass DAO proposals, a largely inactive DAO, and low token price made the exploit easy for the exploiter to drain the treasury of the protocol.  The exploiter purchased the minimum amount of tokens needed to guarentee an approved proposal (~$4000 USD or 1.25% of the total circulating supply of the token) and pushed a malicious proposal to give them the ability to send DAO treasury funds to themselves.  The previous approved vote passed uncontested and with 1% (the minimum threshold) and the exploiter did a test run proposal that was uncontested and followed through with the exploit.|$230k |$230k| [https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/](https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/)
|11/20/2023 | dYdX | Ethereum  | Perpetual | Market manipulation | Low Liquidity | The attacker entered long positions on $YFI on dYdX and pushed up the price of $YFI on spot. The attacker withdrew unrealised profits and entered into more long positions. The price of $YFI 2x-ed but before the attacker could close their positions, $YFI crashed by 35% liquidating the attackers positions. The lack of liquidity led to dYdX covering the positions from their insurance fund | $9m | $11m | https://rekt.news/dydx-rekt/ https://dydx.exchange/blog/sushi-yfi-incident  |
|06/25/2019 | Synthetix | Ethereum | Perpetual | Oracle failure | Trading bot | A bot was able to exploit an error in the price reported for KRW that was 1000x what it should have been. Synthetix took the average of two APIs (one with the error), allowing the bot to make a profit of $1bn in the window that the price was being reported. However the owner of the bot returned the funds in exchange for a bug bounty. | Undisclosed bug bounty | Undisclosed bug bounty | https://blog.synthetix.io/response-to-oracle-incident/ |
|01/01/2024 | Synthetix | Ethereum  | Perpetual | Market manipulation | OI cap denomination  | The $TRB cap on Synthetix ballooned ~50x, from USD 250K (when set initially) to 12.5m USD at the pump's peak. The price was pumped across multiple exchanges, including Binance. The team set the OI caps denominated in TRB tokens, not the notional USD value amount, fully exposing the market to the $TRB pump. | $2m | $2m | https://twitter.com/omeragoldberg/status/1741654953691578737 |
| 7/27/2020 | Ampleforth | Ethereum  | Rebase | System design | Rebasing | Ampleforth tokenomics increases holders’ holdings when the price is above $1 with the aim of the extra supply being sold and so bringing the price back down again. However, individuals held their free tokens, meaning the extra supply never arrived into the market, resulting in a 300% rise in 3 weeks and a 82% plunge in the 5 days after. | NA | NA | https://twitter.com/samkazemian/status/1287700829202337793 https://fullycrypto.com/ampleforth-82-crash-highlights-defi-dangers |
| 10/26/2020 | Harvest Finance | Ethereum  | Yield | System design | Flash loan | Arbitrage swaps were carried out using USDC and USDT and a flash loan. 11.4m USDC was swapped to USDT, pushing the price of UDST up. 60.6m USDT was then deposited into a vault. 11.4m USDT was then swapped back to USDC, pushing the price of USDT down. 61.1m USDT was withdrawn from the vault. Converted to renBTC and exited via Tornado cash. Repeated 32 times. | $24m | $24m | https://rekt.eth.link/harvest-finance-rekt/ |
| 5/16/2021 | bEarnFi | BSC  | Yield | System design | Incorrect asset denomination | Different asset denominations existed between BvaultsBank and the associated BvaultsStrategy between BUSD and ibBUSD - the latter being an interest bearing token. During withdrawal, the contract noted that ibBUSD was being withdrawn and credited the excess in BUSD into a vault (even though there was no new deposit). The act of deposits and withdrawals was repeated till the pool was drained. | $10.8m | $10.8m | https://rekt.news/bearn-rekt/ https://bearndao.medium.com/bvaults-busd-alpaca-strategy-exploit-post-mortem-and-bearn-s-compensation-plan-b0b38c3b5540  |
| 5/20/2021 | Pancake Bunny | BSC | Yield | System design | Excess token mint | A bug in the protocol used PancakeSwap to retrieve the prices of PancakeSwap liquidity providers (BNB-BUSDT / BNB-BUNNY). 8 flash loans were used to manipulate the price on various PancakeSwap pools, creating a skewed calculation of BUNNY from the VaultFliptoFlip vault.This led to the minting of 697,000 BUNNY tokens, which were then sold, causing the price to drop from $146 to $6. | $200m | $38m | https://rekt.news/pancakebunny-rekt/  https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1395196976430526464 https://peckshield.medium.com/pancakebunny-incident-root-cause-analysis-7099f413cc9b  |
| 5/26/2021 | Merlin Labs | BSC | Yield | System design | Excess token mint | The exploter used the wallet balance of CAKE as the profit (performanceFee) which can be easily tampered with by just sending the CAKE token to the vault contract. That is, by sending CAKE to the wallet of the vault contract, the system assumed that the total balance of CAKE was the profit and minted MERL as a reward  | $680k | $680k | https://rekt.news/merlinlabs-rekt/ |
| 6/29/2021 | Merlin Labs | BSC | Yield | System design | Excess token mint | Deposited 0.1WBNB into the vault and then manually transferred 1000BNB into the contract (i.e. the smart contract for the vault) to trick the contract into thinking it has received 1000BNB in rewards, which resulted in the minter producing MERL rewards. | $330k | $330k | https://rekt.news/merlin3-rekt/  |
| 7/18/2021 | PancakeBunny 2  | Polygon | Yield | System design | Excess token mint | Attacker made a small deposit ($19.2k) in one of the Bunny Vaults (USDT-USDC) and using a flash loan, a larger deposit ($48m) directly into MiniChefV2 (USDT-USDC). They then called the function withdrawAll to execute the attack, using the amount deposited in the MiniChefV2 as interest | $2.4m | $2.4m | https://rekt.news/pancakebunny2-rekt/ |
| 7/14/2021 | ApeRocket  | BSC, Polygon | Yield | System design | Excess token mint | Attacker made an initial deposit of 509k $CAKE into the ApeRocket AutoCake vault while another 1.1m $CAKE was transferred to the same vault as the reward. When withdrawn, $SPACE tokens were minted proportional to the rewards. | $1.26m | $1.26m | https://inspexco.medium.com/aperocket-finance-incident-analysis-improper-reward-minting-52153a8958fa https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1415187038605758464 |

| 6/16/2021 | Alchemix  | Ethereum | Lending | System design | Borrow Logic Exploit | Expanding features to the ETH market led to an issue with applying correct debt to alETH borrows and allowed users to withdraw alETH and ETH, resulting in ~2700ETH removed from portocol | $6.5m | $6.5m | https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/137-incident-report-06162021/ |
