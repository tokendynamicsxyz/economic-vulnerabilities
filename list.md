|06/13/2023  |Atlantis Loans |BSC |Governance exploit |Governance, upgradeable contract |The attacker pushed and voted through a governance proposal granting them control of Atlantis Loans’ token contracts. They then upgraded with their own malicious contracts, allowing them to transfer tokens from any address which still had active approvals to Atlantis contracts. |$1m | |[https://rekt.news/atlantis-loans-rekt/](https://rekt.news/atlantis-loans-rekt/) |

|10/15/2021  |Indexed Finance |Ethereum |System design |Liquidity |The exploiter exploited Indexed Finance by using flash loans to manipulate the weights of assets in the DEFI5 and CC10 pools.

|10/19/2022  |Moola Market |CELO |Price Manipulation |Highly profitable trading strategy |A no-code exploit. Exploiter started with $180k in CELO, used some to borrow the protocol’s governance token, which itself was used as collateral. Then the exploiter pumped MOO with the remaining CELO, which allowed them to borrow the remaining assets on |$8.4M |~$525k (returned majority) |[https://rekt.news/moola-markets-rekt/](https://rekt.news/moola-markets-rekt/) |

|06/28/2021  |SafeDollar |Polygon |System design | |The economic exploit in the SafeDollar case involved manipulating the protocol's reward mechanism to claim enormous amounts of SDO tokens.

|02/05/2021  |Yearn |Ethereum | | |The Yearn exploit involved arbitrage of the Yearn DAI v1 vault using 9 flash loans. The exploiter executed a series of complex transactions to manipulate the vault and withdraw funds. The exploit was possible because the withdrawal fee had been turned off for vault migration, making it an opportunistic exploit rather than a fundamental flaw in Yearn's economic design |$11m |$2.7m |[https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt/](https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt/) |

|02/03/2021  | Alpha Finance | Ethereum | Inside job | Lack of controls | This was more of a technical exploit than an economic one, although it did involve manipulating debt numbers.The attackers' contract made the Homora code “believe” that their malicious contract was one of their own in order to manipulate internal debt numbers in their system.This was a private battle between protocol and attacker. The exploited contract was not yet announced, nor was it available to users, meaning they were not directly affected. We have not yet seen such a blatant inside job. The contract was made available in the backend as they were preparing to launch sUSD later in the week. | ~$37.5 million | ~$37.5 million | https://rekt.news/alpha-finance-rekt/ |

|12/17/2018| Warp Finance|Ethereum|Oracle Manipulation|Flash Loan| Attacker used trades from flashloaned tokens to temporarily adjust the price signals of a Uniswapv2Pool, which led WARP to misvalue collateral values.

|10/11/2023| Synthetify DAO| Solana|Governance Exploit|Upgradeable Contract| A combination of a low threshold to pass DAO proposals, a largely inactive DAO, and low token price made the exploit easy for the exploiter to drain the treasury of the protocol.  The exploiter purchased the minimum amount of tokens needed to guarentee an approved proposal (~$4000 USD or 1.25% of the total circulating supply of the token) and pushed a malicious proposal to give them the ability to send DAO treasury funds to themselves.  The previous approved vote passed uncontested and with 1% (the minimum threshold) and the exploiter did a test run proposal that was uncontested and followed through with the exploit.|$230k |$230k| [https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/](https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/)
