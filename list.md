|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 03/19/2025 | Duo Exchange / Protocol Ring | Blast | DEX | Governance exploit | Protocol interaction loophole and voter apathy | A figure associated with both Duo Exchange and Protocol Ring single sidedly passed governance proposals and exploited a protocol interaction loophole to remove ETH backing from DETH using fwETH. The individual deposited ETH to mint DETH tokens but then found a way to withdraw the backing ETH through fwETH tokens without returning the corresponding DETH, undermining the 1:1 backing principle of the protocol. | Unknown | Unknown | https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ring/proposals |  |
| 09/06/2024 | Polymarket | Polygon | Prediction Market | Price manipulation | Spot liquidity | A derivative market of the main US presidential election market spawned, attracting enough liquidity to make manipulating the underlying market profitable for a motivated group. Whales unsuccessfully attempted to manipulate the underlying presidential market in order to profit on the derivative market. |  |  | https://x.com/Dumpster_DAO/status/1832148090452898235 |  |
| 07/29/2024 | Compound Finance | Ethereum | Lending | Governance exploit | Hostile takeover |Golden Boys voting bloc led by Humpy accumulated COMP tokens over several months and pushed a proposal for COMP to earn yield in a novel scheme, granting themselves an additional 500,000 COMP in the process, giving them de facto control over the DAO. |  | $25m |[https://blockonomi.com/compound-finance-faces-controversy-over-24-million-proposal/](https://blockonomi.com/compound-finance-faces-controversy-over-24-million-proposal/) |  |
| 06/10/2024 | UwU Lend | BSC | Lending | Price Manipulation |  | Exploiter borrowed tokens to manipulate prices in several pools to get a lower price when borrowing, and a higher price for the same tokens on being liquidated. |  | $23m | https://rekt.news/uwulend-rekt/ |  |
| 06/25/2024 | Deans List/MetaDAO | Solana | Prediction Market | Price manipulation | Spot liquidity | A futarchy-based decision market utilizes a TWAP mechanism that updates the price based on a fixed number observations (or on-chain volume on the market) over a certain period of time.  Due to the lack of activity on the buy market, the TWAP price was manipulated by buying cheap fail tokens, pumping the fail market volume to manipulate the TWAP-derived price in the fail market, allowing the user to dump the now higher priced Dean List Token from the fail market on the spot market. | 6.6k USD | 6.6k USD | https://blog.metadao.fi/deans-list-proposal-2-b1cbca456469 |  |
| 02/23/2024 | Compound Finance | Ethereum | Lending | Oracle | Oracle configuration | Compound's fallback oracle was triggered by an anomolous but legitimate 40% intrablock spike in the $UNI price. The difference between the primary oracle Chainlink, and the fallback oracle - a TWAP on the $UNI Uniswap v2 pool - was above the threshold, the fallback oracle price was used for Compound loans. Arbitrage bots quickly created loans on Compound which led to around $3 million of bad debt. |  | $3m | https://x.com/uriklarman/status/1761062094600864025 |  |

| 01/01/2024 | Synthetix | Ethereum  | Perpetual | Market manipulation | OI cap denomination  | The $TRB cap on Synthetix ballooned ~50x, from USD 250K (when set initially) to 12.5m USD at the pump's peak. The price was pumped across multiple exchanges, including Binance. The team set the OI caps denominated in TRB tokens, not the notional USD value amount, fully exposing the market to the $TRB pump. | $2m | $2m | https://twitter.com/omeragoldberg/status/1741654953691578737 |
| 11/20/2023 | dYdX | Ethereum | Perpetual | Market manipulation | Spot liquidity | The attacker entered long positions on $YFI on dYdX and pushed up the price of $YFI on spot. The attacker withdrew unrealised profits and entered into more long positions. The price of $YFI 2x-ed but before the attacker could close their positions, $YFI crashed by 35% liquidating the attackers positions. The lack of liquidity led to dYdX covering the positions from their insurance fund | $9m | $11m | https://rekt.news/dydx-rekt/ https://dydx.exchange/blog/sushi-yfi-incident  |

| 10/11/2023 | Synthetify | Solana |  | Governance |  | A combination of a low threshold to pass DAO proposals, a largely inactive DAO, and low token price anabled the exploiter to drain the Synthetify treasury. The exploiter purchased the minimum amount of tokens needed to guarantee an approved proposal (~$4000 USD or 1.25% of the total circulating supply of the token) and pushed a malicious proposal to give them the ability to send DAO treasury funds to themselves. | $230k | $230k | https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/ |

| 06/13/2023 | Atlantis Loans | BSC | | Governance exploit | Governance, upgradeable contract | The attacker pushed and voted through a governance proposal granting them control of Atlantis Loans’ token contracts. They then upgraded with their own malicious contracts, allowing them to transfer tokens from any address which still had active approvals to Atlantis contracts. | $1m | | https://rekt.news/atlantis-loans-rekt/ |
| 05/29/2023 | Jimbo | Arbitrum  | Stablecoin |  |  | Jimbo tried to make a rebalancing stablecoin. The attacker took a flash loan of 10k ETH to buy JIMBO tokens, inflating their price.
