|02/23/2024  | Compound Finance |Ethereum |  | Oracle Misconfiguration | TWAP |Compound's fallback oracle was triggered by an anomolous but legitimate 40% intrablock spike in the $UNI price. The difference between the primary oracle Chainlink, and the fallback oracle - a TWAP on the $UNI Uniswap v2 pool - was above the threshold, the fallback oracle price was used for Compound loans. Arbitrage bots quickly created loans on Compound which led to around $3 million of bad debt. |  |$3m | https://x.com/uriklarman/status/1761062094600864025 |  |

The previous approved vote passed uncontested and with 1% (the minimum threshold) and the exploiter did a test run proposal that was uncontested and followed through with the exploit.|$230k |$230k| [https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/](https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exploit-dao-hacker/)
